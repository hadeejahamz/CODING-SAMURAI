# Spam/Ham Classifier

Hi, I made this projct during my one month internship programme, conducted by Coding Samurai. This is a simple email classification project using machine learning techniques. The project includes a logistic regression model trained on the Spambase dataset, providing predictions on whether an email is spam or ham.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.x)
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## Model and Data

The project utilizes a logistic regression model trained on the Spambase dataset. TF-IDF vectorization is employed for feature extraction.
